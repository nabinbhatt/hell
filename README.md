# hell
He thought he had found the perfect escape. 

A virtual reality game that promised to immerse him in a world of horror and thrill. 

He put on the headset and entered the code: hell. 

He expected to see demons, 

zombies, 

and ghosts. 

He did not expect to see his own face staring back at him from 

every screen, 
every mirror, 
every window. 

He tried to take off the headset, but it was locked. 

He tried to exit the game, but there was no option. 

He tried to scream, but no one heard him. 

He was trappedd in his own personal hell, 

and there was no way out.
